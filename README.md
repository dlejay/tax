# TaX â€” the Tiny arXiv TeX         

TaX is a TeX distribution for macOS,
following the minimalism of the excellent [TinyTex](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex).

It focuses on two main points:

1. TaX installs the texlive distribution currently in use by arXiv.
This guaranties that if your `.tex` files compile with TaX, they
should compile without problems on the arXiv servers.

2. TaX never assumes you can type a password.
It can thus be installed on guest sessions of computers you do not own.
